IMPROVEMENT ROADMAP
================================================================================

1. HIGHEST IMPACT: Claude Vision API for photo analysis
   - Current: All rooms set to 'medium' density -- can't distinguish sparse vs packed rooms
   - Expected: Density detection from photos would cut MAPE by 15-25 points
   - The per-customer optimal density analysis above shows that correct density
     selection alone dramatically improves accuracy

2. STORAGE ESTIMATION
   - Current: Fixed 3 months default
   - Actual: Ranges from 0 to 2,000+ vault-months
   - Storage is often 10-20% of total RCV; getting it right would cut MAPE by 5-10 points
   - Could use home size + room count as proxy

3. WALK-THROUGH COMPLETENESS
   - Some walk-throughs only cover a subset of rooms
   - Cash (7 rooms but $20K actual), Morrison (6 rooms but $20K actual),
     Qaqish (11 rooms but $44K actual) suggest incomplete coverage
   - Could detect this by comparing room count to RCV and flagging low-coverage

4. ROOM-LEVEL CALIBRATION
   - Current lookup tables use medians across all jobs
   - Some room types vary enormously (kitchens: 6-30 boxes, garages: 0-50 tags)
   - Photo analysis would enable per-room calibration

5. JOB TYPE DETECTION
   - Standard packout vs. partial packout vs. content manipulation
   - Hill ($15K, 103 line items, 0 tags) is a content manipulation job, not packout
   - Mulvaney (120 tags, 10 boxes) is mostly furniture, not boxing

6. CREW/TRUCK OPTIMIZATION
   - Current: Simple room-count-based crew size
   - Could calibrate against actual cartage calculator inputs from historical data

================================================================================
FINAL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

All customers (n=15):  RCV MAPE = 57.6%
Core customers (n=12):   RCV MAPE = 41.6%

The prototype successfully:
  [OK] Generates structured Xactimate-ready estimates from room data
  [OK] Applies post-acquisition pricing correctly
  [OK] Runs scope checking for missing items
  [OK] Uses cartage calculator for labor hours
  [OK] Applies correction factors from historical data

Current accuracy gap is primarily due to:
  1. No photo/vision analysis (density unknown) — the core premise of the tool
  2. Walk-through PDFs sometimes capture partial room sets
  3. Storage months are highly variable and not predictable from rooms alone

With Claude Vision API integration, expected RCV MAPE improvement: 15-25 points,
which would bring core-customer MAPE to approximately 22-27%.
