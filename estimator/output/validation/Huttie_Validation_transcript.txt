[00:01 - 00:06] We're on site at Huddy of Capitan. Right now I'm in the hallway leading to the primary bedroom.
[00:06 - 00:14] This house has a lot of great art in it, so we're going to be using an art vendor to manage the art on it.
[00:14 - 00:18] We have individual pictures of all of the art that we'll work with the vendor on.
[00:18 - 00:25] Walking into the primary, we are going to be working in areas that have flooring, the wood flooring,
[00:25 - 00:28] or if they're replacing that, you can see that the wood flooring ends here.
[00:28 - 00:34] So we won't be looking in the powder room or in the water closet or in the bathroom.
[00:34 - 00:39] Walking into the closet, though, looks like some of the items have already been taken out,
[00:39 - 00:45] so we need to consider whether or not we're going to be moving these to the rental or storing them off-site for them.
[00:45 - 00:53] Not a ton here. These drawers do have items in them, so we want to account for the drawers.
[00:54 - 00:57] Some linens here, more items here.
[00:57 - 01:02] We've advised Kenny from Charm Restoration that we do not move firearms,
[01:02 - 01:08] so we may need to work with the vendor if there are firearms, which we told there are in the home.
[01:08 - 01:14] Closet, drawers, more things in the drawers, so we want to make sure we're keeping a good eye on that.
[01:14 - 01:21] Notice how neat the drawers are, so we want to make sure we're paying attention to that and meeting that standard.
[01:21 - 01:24] Leaving the closet, mirror here.
[01:24 - 01:28] Going into the primary bedroom, again, everything is neat and perfectly organized.
[01:28 - 01:32] More art. Can you touch that here for me? Okay.
[01:32 - 01:39] Again, these are a laminate, so we want to make sure that we're accounting for items in there as well,
[01:39 - 01:43] but that scratching on stuff like this is very difficult to repair.
[01:45 - 01:49] More items in here. We've got beautiful stuff here.
[01:49 - 01:52] We'll want to get with a contractor.
[01:52 - 02:00] These will not be going. Anything that's backed on the tile we'll leave in place, it sounds like, so we'll keep it there.
[02:00 - 02:03] But you've got a beautiful sitting area as well.
[02:03 - 02:11] We'll account for heading out into another sitting area where there's a television.
[02:11 - 02:14] This is backed on the marble, so it'll be staying in place.
[02:14 - 02:20] Very nice table here, matching sofas.
[02:20 - 02:22] You've got some stuff over here.
[02:22 - 02:24] Drawers can be left empty.
[02:24 - 02:30] Going into this closet, it's like an A.V. closet.
[02:30 - 02:34] Pretty typical stuff here. We'll want to maybe talk to somebody about moving these.
[02:34 - 02:37] These are going to need to come out to the extent comfortable with the homeowners,
[02:37 - 02:42] so we can either coordinate with them on their previous A.V. team.
[02:42 - 02:47] Or we'll just carry a budget for it.
[02:47 - 02:49] More art in the entry.
[02:49 - 02:51] This table would come with us.
[02:51 - 02:54] This and this would go to the vendor.
[02:54 - 02:55] A little hutch here.
[02:55 - 03:02] Some more items in here that we would likely use our antler for, to be honest, because I'm not sure they're valued.
[03:02 - 03:05] Into another seating area.
[03:05 - 03:06] Similar setup.
[03:06 - 03:10] One of the things we talked to Kenny about is if this needs to come down,
[03:10 - 03:19] the electrician can take it down, and then we can work to safely store it likely on site in the garage.
[03:19 - 03:22] Art here would be included in the antlers.
[03:22 - 03:23] Scope.
[03:23 - 03:26] Couch.
[03:26 - 03:27] Hey, Kenny, anything on the floor?
[03:27 - 03:31] Does this need to be cleaned, like the rugs, or were they not affected?
[03:31 - 03:33] Those weren't affected, so they're not.
[03:33 - 03:34] Okay, perfect.
[03:34 - 03:36] Keep that in there.
[03:36 - 03:39] Into the dining area.
[03:39 - 03:41] Got the chairs, some of the items on top.
[03:41 - 03:44] Heavy table, so we want to keep an eye on this.
[03:44 - 03:46] This is the piece of resistance.
[03:46 - 03:49] This is going to be going with the art vendor for sure.
[03:49 - 03:52] We don't want any part of this, so we'll make sure that we talk to them about this.
[03:52 - 03:54] It's a very special piece.
[03:54 - 03:57] Again, we'll make sure the homeowners are comfortable with that as well.
[03:57 - 04:00] Into another living area.
[04:00 - 04:03] Got kind of a broken-down sectional.
[04:03 - 04:07] Some very nice chess pieces that I like to go with the art handler, as well as this ball on top.
[04:07 - 04:10] And then more furniture, as you can see.
[04:10 - 04:15] Into the less formal dining area.
[04:15 - 04:20] Leather chairs, glass top, more art to be handled.
[04:20 - 04:24] Countertops are relatively empty, so we'll remove anything on the countertops.
[04:24 - 04:30] For now, the scope is not going to include anything in the drawers or in the cabinets.
[04:30 - 04:36] The dust control by the contractor should manage that, but we'll be on call should that change.
[04:36 - 04:39] And then we've got two more rooms back here.
[04:39 - 04:46] We've got a couple items in the hallway, which will need to be moved.
[04:46 - 04:49] This and that into another bedroom.
[04:49 - 04:52] More art, more art, more art, more art.
[04:52 - 04:54] A TV that will come off the wall.
[04:54 - 04:57] Chairs, a table, closet.
[04:57 - 05:00] The closet has drawers.
[05:00 - 05:05] Drawers do contain items in them, so we'll want to make sure that we're accounting for those.
[05:05 - 05:15] And, again, note how well everything is put away.
[05:15 - 05:28] Hanging items in here.
[05:28 - 05:30] Side tables, side tables with lights.
[05:30 - 05:32] You've got a stuffed animal on top of there.
[05:32 - 05:37] Notice how it's sitting.
[05:37 - 05:42] Beautiful bed that we'll want to make sure we can accurately manage.
[05:42 - 05:47] You can see there's some existing damage down here that we would note.
[05:47 - 05:49] Bench.
[05:49 - 05:51] Nothing in here for now.
[05:51 - 05:53] As you can see, the floor stops, so it won't be going into there.
[05:53 - 05:55] Beautiful bathroom now.
[05:55 - 06:02] I'll turn this light off when I leave the room.
[06:02 - 06:04] Finally, this is the final bedroom.
[06:04 - 06:06] There's a bathroom in here.
[06:06 - 06:12] Flooring stops, though, with the tiles, so we won't be using that.
[06:12 - 06:14] More furniture.
[06:14 - 06:16] Closet here.
[06:16 - 06:21] There are some items in these drawers.
[06:21 - 06:23] Another art piece on the ground.
[06:24 - 06:26] Books.
[06:26 - 06:31] 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.
[06:31 - 06:38] So, you know, probably around 35 books here, probably another 35 books there.
[06:38 - 06:39] Some other pieces.
[06:39 - 06:41] These can likely be carried off by us.
[06:41 - 06:42] Linens on the ground.
[06:42 - 06:44] Turn off this light.
[06:44 - 06:46] Bedroom.
[06:46 - 06:49] Probably a king-size bed, just from a quick glance at it.
[06:49 - 06:54] This is a very nice bookshelf that we'll want to take time to figure out how we want to move it.
[06:54 - 06:56] All these items on here are relatively delicate.
[06:56 - 06:58] We'll talk to the handler about moving those.
[06:58 - 07:00] P-Rows, Hank Aaron balls.
[07:00 - 07:02] We'll be going with the handler.
[07:02 - 07:07] TV on the wall.
[07:07 - 07:08] Last couple notes.
[07:08 - 07:17] New flooring is going in throughout, so when we do a pack-back, we will make sure to carry costs for RAM board and appropriate protection
[07:17 - 07:20] to ensure that we are not causing any additional damage.
[07:20 - 07:23] That is the entirety of the scope.
[07:23 - 07:28] Please look at any photos and notes as well to help better understand.
