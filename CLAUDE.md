# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**Assitant** — a new project in early setup. The repository is hosted at https://github.com/packoutsev/Assitant.git.

## Important: Repository Location

This git repo is initialized in the Windows user home directory (`C:\Users\matth`). Many unrelated OS/profile files (AppData, NTUSER.DAT, OneDrive, etc.) are visible to git. A proper `.gitignore` should be added before committing to avoid tracking these files.

## Current State

- No source code, build system, or tests exist yet
- Only file tracked: `README.md`
